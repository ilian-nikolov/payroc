The application uses Java 8 for compatibility reasons.

Running the application
=======================

Step 1: From the root folder run the following command:

    Note: An alternative to the above command would be to open the project in an IDE 
          and run class ShortenUrlApplication from there.

    Open browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
